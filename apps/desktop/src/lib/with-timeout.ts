 * (DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS 15 s in electron/ssh-connection.ts), the
 * sequential ssh execs that probe platform, locate the runtime and read its
 * version (DEFAULT_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS 20 s each), the spawned backend's ready
 * sentinel (DEFAULT_READY_TIMEOUT_MS 45 s in electron/remote-lifecycle.ts) and
 * the port forward (DEFAULT_FORWARD_TIMEOUT_MS 15 s). Their sum is ~135 s, and
 * a *healthy* cold dial lands far inside it — measured 37-64 s against a 2 GB
 * VPS over Windows ssh (no mux: every stage is a fresh ssh process plus a cold
 * `serve` boot).
 *
 * Bounding that chain with RECONNECT_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_MS reported
 * "Could not connect to <source>" for switches that were still dialing, and
 * then connected anyway (withTimeout does not cancel the dial), which read as a
 * failure the user had to retry. The per-IPC budget still catches the #93454
